# Rainfall-Prediction-Project
This project is a simple web-based application that predicts rainfall based on temperature, humidity, and pressure data. The prediction is powered by a machine learning model trained on weather data. The application is built using Flask for the backend, with a user-friendly interface designed using HTML and CSS.
