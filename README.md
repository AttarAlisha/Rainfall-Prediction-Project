# Rainfall-Prediction-Project
This project is a simple web-based application that predicts rainfall based on temperature, humidity, and pressure data. The prediction is powered by a machine learning model trained on weather data. The application is built using Flask for the backend, with a user-friendly interface designed using HTML and CSS.

# Features
Takes inputs for temperature (Â°C), humidity (%), and pressure (hPa).
Predicts rainfall (mm) based on these inputs using a pre-trained machine learning model.
Displays real-time feedback to users in a user-friendly web interface.
Provides non-negative rainfall prediction output.
# Technology Stack
Backend: Flask (Python)
